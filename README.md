# base-control
A page has been created and contains a header and has the logo of the Smart Methods Company and the references for the companyâ€™s website. Then, the base control page has been created and buttons have been placed in it to move forward, back, right, left and the stop button, as well as a box to move to the arm control page. Then the chat assistant worked with the robot and it was linked with base_control.html page After that, I linked it to the database on trends.php . page All mission pages in html are linked to one page in css And its name is task1.css
